# Excellent Ergonomics
## A Reinforcment Learning Approach to Typing

Excellent Ergonomics is a demonstration of reinforcement
learning optimization. The learning agent, upon learning
the best positions for keyboard keys, builds up a keymap
that will result in the least amount of finger movement
(and therefore the highest speed) for typing a given
passage.

Once given enough data, the agent will find the most consistent
keymap throughout all of its learning and give that to the user.
This keymap will differ depending on what typing passages are 
given to the agent.
